# Welcome to Agate Examples

This is a young work in progress.

This site is a an unofficial extension of the [agate](http://agate.readthedocs.io/en/1.6.0/) Python library. While the [Cookbook](http://agate.readthedocs.io/en/1.6.0/cookbook.html) and [Tutorial](https://github.com/wireservice/agate/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb) are a good start to learning and using agates, these pages are a compendium of examples and variations that I would like to remember. Perhaps they are useful to others, as well.

I use [agate](http://agate.readthedocs.io/en/1.6.0/) in my work at the Statesman to build transparent, repeatable data pipelines and analysis in the course of reporting, usually in conjuction with [Jypter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).

Some examples:

* [Mixed Beverage Receipts](https://github.com/statesman/mixbev-receipts/blob/master/notebooks/Mixed-beverages-2017-06.ipynb)
* [Oil spill data](https://github.com/statesman/oil-spills/blob/master/Spills.ipynb) as it related to the Magellan Midstream Partners spill of July 13 in Bastrop County.
* [Texas public school accountability ratings](https://github.com/statesman/tx-school-data/blob/master/processing/2017-texas-school-accountability-data.ipynb)
