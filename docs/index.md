Welcome to agate-examples
==========================================

[A very young work in progress]

The goal of this site is to have a store of examples using the [agate](http://agate.readthedocs.io/en/1.6.0/) Python library. While the [Cookbook](http://agate.readthedocs.io/en/1.6.0/cookbook.html) and [Tutorial](https://github.com/wireservice/agate/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb) have some good examples, these are variations that I would like to remember. Perhaps others can benefit from this as well.


## A start

* [import](import.md)
* [filters](filters.md)
* [compute](compute.md)
